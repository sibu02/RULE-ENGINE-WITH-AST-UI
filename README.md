# Rule Engine with AST Visualization
A powerful Rule Engine application that leverages Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures for creating, modifying, combining, and evaluating rules. This app is designed to process complex rule conditions and provide a user-friendly UI for managing and visualizing these rules.

# Features
1. Rule Creation and Management
Create custom rules using AND, OR, and condition operators.
Nested rules and complex conditions can be defined using the AST structure.
Supports modification of existing rules and their configurations.
2. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Visualization
Visualize the structure of rules as an AST, making it easier to understand nested conditions.
User interface built to display tree nodes for conditions and operators in a clear, intuitive layout.
Supports interactive modifications of tree nodes, enabling real-time updates to the rule structure.
3. Rule Evaluation Engine
Process incoming data against the defined rules to trigger specific actions or decisions.
Evaluates nested and complex rules based on the AST representation.
Results are returned in real-time, showing rule matches or misses based on the provided conditions.
4. UI for Rule Interaction and Visualization
Professional and mobile-friendly UI using React, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI.
Built-in components for creating, editing, and visualizing AST nodes.
Provides a clear view of rule conditions, operators, and node relationships within the AST.
5. Notifications
Integrated notification system using React Hot Toast to display alerts for rule changes, evaluation results, and errors.
Visual feedback provided for each stage of rule configuration and evaluation.

Getting Started
To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

# Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/rule-engine-app.git
cd rule-engine-app
Configure the Application:

Set up environment variables for database credentials and any other necessary configuration.
Run Docker:

Build and run the Docker container for easy deployment.
bash
Copy code
docker build -t rule-engine .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 rule-engine
Access the Application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
Endpoints
Below are the primary API endpoints:

POST /api/rules/create: Create a new rule with an AST structure.
GET /api/rules/{ruleId}: Retrieve details of a specific rule.
PUT /api/rules/{ruleId}/update: Update an existing rule.
POST /api/rules/evaluate: Evaluate data against a rule.
DELETE /api/rules/{ruleId}/delete: Delete a specific rule.
Rule Configuration and AST Structure
Example of AST JSON Structure
Each rule is represented as an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), where each node can be an operator (e.g., AND, OR) or an operand (e.g., age > 30).

json
Copy code
{
  "type": "OPERATOR",
  "value": "AND",
  "left": {
    "type": "CONDITION",
    "value": "age > 30"
  },
  "right": {
    "type": "OPERATOR",
    "value": "OR",
    "left": {
      "type": "CONDITION",
      "value": "salary > 5000"
    },
    "right": {
      "type": "CONDITION",
      "value": "location == 'NY'"
    }
  }
}
# Explanation of AST Nodes
Type: Node type, either OPERATOR or CONDITION.
Value: If the type is OPERATOR, the value can be AND or OR; if the type is CONDITION, it will be a specific condition (e.g., age > 30).
Left and Right: These represent the left and right child nodes of an operator node.
This AST format allows for the dynamic creation and evaluation of complex rule structures.
